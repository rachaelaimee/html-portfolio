<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hello there! 
</p>
<p>
  I'm Rachael, a passionate female software developer with a love for all things tech and beyond. With a keyboard as my paintbrush, I craft digital experiences that not only function flawlessly but also captivate and inspire.
  My journey in the world of coding is fueled by an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Every line of code I write is an opportunity to learn and grow, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.

  When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me surrounded by my beloved furry companions. Ekko and Freyja, my loyal dogs, accompany me on outdoor adventures, while Rengar and Jinx, my mischievous cats, provide endless entertainment indoors. And let's not forget Quilly Savage, my pint-sized African pygmy hedgehog, who adds a dash of quirkiness to my life.

  Beyond the screen, I find joy in the analog world through crafting and art. There's something magical about creating with your hands, whether it's knitting a cozy scarf or painting a vibrant canvas. And when the sun sets, you'll often find me curled up with a bowl of popcorn, ready to dive into the thrilling world of horror movies.
</p>
<p>
  Join me on this exciting journey where technology meets creativity, and together, let's build something extraordinary.
